logical: qubits

name: 'Golden code'
introduced: '\cite{arXiv:1712.08578}'

description: |
  Hyperbolic surface code derived from tessellations of a four-dimensional manifold. To classify this code, we define a four-dimensional manifold \(M\) with tessellation \(M_i\). 
  
  Representing qubits, are the two-faces or polygons of \(M_i\), \(X\)-type stabilizers are the one-faces or edges of \(M_i\), and the \(Z\)-type stabilizers are the three-faces or polyhedrons of \(M_i\). 
  For dimension and length, the number of logical qubits is the rank of \(M\)'s second homology group, while the length is attributed to the number of physical qubits.
