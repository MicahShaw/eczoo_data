name: 'Rank-metric code'
introduced: '\cite{doi:10.1016/0097-3165(78)90015-8}'

description: |
  Also called a \textit{Delsarte code}. Each codeword is a \textit{matrix} over \(GF(q)\), with codewords forming a \(GF(q)\)-linear subspace, and with the metric being the rank of the difference of matrices. The distance \(d\) is the minimum rank of all nonzero matrices in the code. Rank-metric codes on \(n\times m\) matrices are denoted as \([n\times m,k,d]_q\).

  The number of codewords satisfies \(k \leq \max(n, m) M\), where \(M\) is the maximum rank of all matrices in the code. Codes that achieve this bound with equality are called \textit{Delsarte optimal anticodes}.

protection: 'Protects against errors with rank \(\leq \lfloor \frac{d-1}2 \rfloor\).'

    - 'Polynomial-reconstruction Berlekamp-Welch based decoder \cite{doi:10.1007/11779360_4}.'
    - 'Berlekamp-Massey based decoder \cite{doi:10.1109/ISIT.2004.1365435}.'

#  decoders:
#    - 'The method of decoding is analogous to the Berlekamp-Welch algorithm.'
#    - 'Error locator polynomial \(E(y_i) = E(f(\alpha_i))\).'
#    - 'This problem is linearized to \(E(y_i) = N(\alpha_i)\). Using the known degrees of these polynomials \(deg_q f \leq k-1, deg_q E \leq t\), this problem becomes a set of linear equations which can be solved for \(E\) and \(f\).'
#    - 'Finally we perform \(E(y_i - f_i(\alpha_i)) = 0\) to solve for the error vector.'

realizations:
  - 'Code used in digital watermarking. The rank code provides efficient correction against luminance tampering and image-slicing distortion from the consistency of the rank against alterations such as column-swapping \cite{doi:10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462647}.'

  - 'See Ref. \cite{arXiv:1410.1333} for a discussion of MacWilliams identities and the relationship between rank metric and Gabidulin codes.'
